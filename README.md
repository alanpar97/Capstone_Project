## Background

Mexico City is the capital and largest city of Mexico, where over **9.2** million people live and has a population density of **6,163.3** per square kilometer.[1] The metropolitan area of Great Mexico City has a population of **21.3** million, making it the second largest metropolitan area in America, only behind Sao Paulo, Brazil.
The city is divided in **15** subdivisions (or boroughs), and there are around **15,000** restaurants.[2] Another fact is that the life expectancy of a restaurant in Mexico City is of 6.9 years, not as many as in other Mexican cities. 

According to INEGI, Mexico City has a large amount of restaurants per thousand people in comparison to the national average. The subdivision of Benito Juarez has 8 restaurants per thousand people, whereas the national average is of 3 restaurantes per thousand people.[3] There is a high competition but also a large market, hence one of the first decisions that restaurant owners need to make when establishing a new restaurant is **where** to open it.

## Problem

In this project, we will be thinking as a potential restaurant owner. We want to investigate and determine which would be the best category for our new restaurant, and where to open it based on factors such as low competition, low real state costs, dense population, among others.

## Data

In order to do this project, we will use the following data:
- *[Foursquare API Data](https://developer.foursquare.com/)* that contains information of the most common venues in each borough in Mexico City. 
- *[INEGI API Data](https://www.inegi.org.mx/servicios/api_indicadores.html)* that contains data about real state prices, population density.
- *[Wikipedia - Mexican Postal Codes](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:C%C3%B3digos_postales_mexicanos#Distrito_Federal)* that contains the postal codes of each neighbourhood in Mexico City
